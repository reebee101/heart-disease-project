# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data.
The goal is to build, train, and evaluate models that can assist in early detection of heart disease.

## 📌 Project Overview

Load and explore heart disease dataset

Perform data preprocessing and feature selection

Train and evaluate different machine learning models

Compare accuracy and performance metrics

Provide insights into factors affecting heart disease risk

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains patient health records with attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Resting ECG

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

Exercise Induced Angina

ST Depression

Number of Major Vessels

Target (1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease)
